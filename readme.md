# Purpose
This program is for endurance athletes who would like to calculate their daily nutrition and hydration goals based on body weight and the type of training.

## ðŸš´ Daily Nutrition & Electrolytes
### ðŸ¥— Daily (Off-Bike) Nutrition

These are the baseline intakes you aim for throughout the day to stay fueled and recovered:

#### Carbs (g/kg):

Rest: 3â€“5

Moderate training: 5â€“7

Heavy training/racing: 7â€“10
(includes ride fuel but also normal meals/snacks)

#### Protein (g/kg): 1.6â€“2.0
(mainly meals/snacks, not during ride unless recovery drink)

#### Fat (g/kg): ~1.0 (20â€“30% of total calories)

### Electrolytes (baseline):

Sodium: 30â€“60 mg/kg

Potassium: 50â€“70 mg/kg

Magnesium: 5â€“6 mg/kg

Calcium: 15â€“19 mg/kg

### ðŸš´ On-Bike Fueling (During Training/Race)

This is in addition to daily baseline needs, and scales with ride length/intensity:

#### Carbs:

<1 h: optional (just water)

1â€“2 h: 30â€“60 g/hr

2â€“4 h (or high intensity): 60â€“90 g/hr (multiple carb sources: glucose + fructose)

#### Fluids: ~500â€“1,000 ml/hr (based on sweat rate & weather)

#### Sodium: ~400â€“800 mg/hr (more in heat / salty sweater)
